# Svelte SPA & Esbuild

Minimal build script for a Svelte SPA that loads a package with a Svelte component.

Wrote comments in the **esbuild.mjs** script for key parts.

## Caveats

* no automatic rebuild or dev server _yet_
* es5 is not well supported so don't use this if you need es5
* asset copying is _baaaad_
